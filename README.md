# gif_searcher

You can search for your gifs using GIPHY API

## Getting Started

This app was made using Flutter 3.16.3 and Dart 3.2.3.
To execute it, you should run the command `flutter run --dart-define=GIPHY_API_KEY=<your_giphy_API_key_here>` in your terminal.

For making this project, I used Clean Architecture (Domain Driven Design), flutter_bloc, dio, and sqflite.
